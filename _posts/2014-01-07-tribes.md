Recently, there has been a great deal of discussion on the topic of tribes.
[Seth Godin](https://twitter.com/ThisIsSethsBlog)
described a [tribe](http://www.amazon.com/Tribes-We-Need-You-Lead/dp/1591842336/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389115690&sr=8-1&keywords=tribes)
as "a group of people, large or small, who are connected
to one another." Those of us who have been participating in open source software have much to be proud of,
tribes are the primary source of power behind open source software and, together,
 we are transforming how people learn and work together.

Tribes are our most important organizational structure that provide focus around a topic or purpose. Each tribe
provides leadership and ways for individuals to connect with one another.

As such, our open source tribes provide a gateway through which thousands of individuals have entered and participated.
 Tribes are an important source of mentorship and learning and many of us have found our involvement in tribes
 has resulted in increasing personal skill, working towards professional goals, better public speaking,
 improved software development and documentation.

 Our involvement in tribes have helped us to create, improve, and share knowledge.

In a world that all too often feels indifferent and cold to our personal situations,
tribes can be important source of support. At a very basic level, every one of us want to belong.
Tribes enable personal connections through which we have found lifelong friendships and others who
genuinely care about us. As a result of these bonds, we benefit from valuable
feedback, answers, advise, criticism, encouragement, credit, and recognition.

If you find yourself a leader of a tribe, you already know how challenging and important your job is in helping
 members stay positive, open, productive, and successful. Congratulations on helping make the world a little
 better place. Stay encouraged!

There is no limit to the number of tribes that can exist. There is no limit to the number of tribes
to we can each belong. What we have is a shortage of leaders, so please do step up and drive focus
and involvement in an area you are interested in leading. The more people do this, the more benefit
our shared efforts provide the world.
