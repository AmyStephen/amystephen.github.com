This is one of those *thankfully* rare examples of how not to ever, ever, ever, please do not ever,
use pronouns like this, again! =)

It goes without saying, ![not all PHP developers are men.]({{ site.url }}/assets/maleprogrammers.jpg)


Now, before you say it, I realize this graphic was likely produced by someone who might not use English as a primary
language. Further, I get it that there is nothing in the text that specifically excludes women by saying directly.
I also agree with your unspoken comment that, as people, we tend to be overly sensitive.

However. This piece clearly excluded women from consideration and does so
 on an education piece related to hoe yo hire PHP developers. Not cool.

In terms of content, it's quite good! Further, it's colorful, uses a balanced visual design, catches
the readers attention. It would be awesome to find the author and encourage them to fix the problems
 and produce a copy worthy of sharing!

Here are examples of how to improve the information in a way that is inclusive:

1. Developer images: Since there are two pictures of developers, change one to an image of a female developer.
3. Change: 'Ask About His Experience" to 'Ask about experience'.
4. Change: 'you should ask a developer is about his experience' to
'Ask developers about their experience.'
5. Change: 'Ask About His PHP & HTML Programming Knowledge" to 'Ask about PHP and HTML Programming Knowledge."

In general, it's best to avoid any pronoun use. Just set a goal to not use it in your writing.

For this particular piece, is gender relevant? As the piece suggests, when hiring developers, experience, skill,
work ethic, reliability, enthusiasm, willingness to learn, easy to get along with,
and so on, and the characteristics desired. Since none of those characteristics is more likely to be
exhibited in a specific gender, there is absolutely no reason to introduce gender, at all.

Like all things, learning correct approaches is important and it takes practice.
That's as true for learning how to correctly sanitize data as it is to learning how to communicate appropriately.
Since it is obviously not a goal to exclude women, don't do it! Learn! You'd be surprised how easy it is to
avoid pronouns in your writing. Just takes a woman's touch. ;-)
