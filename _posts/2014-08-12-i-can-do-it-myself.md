I don't need help. I am not needy. I can do it myself. I am not a victim. I am not oppressed. I can do it myself.

That "can do attitude" is important for success but it can be very unhealthy and counterproductive for helping others.

Most women are aware of the wage gap. We understand we work in an industry where we are considered as rare as unicorns. We have experienced the negativity of gender bias, each with our own stories about how difficult the journey has been. The vulgar conversations, the come ons, the discrimination, watching less experienced men we trained get opportunities we deserved.

Anytime we are wronged, it leaves us feeling vulnerable, unloved, alone. Discrimination brings shame. We know if we complain about being passed over, a list of reasons will be presented to hold us in our place. We learn to be silent. To wait. To work harder. To keep it inside. To look at it with "perspective", I mean, it's not like we had a child die, right?

We internalize.

I'm here to tell you that you can live that way for decades. You can be successful if you are willing to put in the extra effort and time and take that time from personal growth or support of your family or rest.

It's a matter of attitude whether someone is helping maintain the status quo or helping the community adapt for more diverse participation.

If your first response to disappointment in 5% women speakers at a community conference is "Yea, but, how many women applied?", you are responding defensively and introducing a barrier to addressing the issue.

If you say "Maybe women don't want to code.", your response suggests anyone working on ways to encourage those who do want to code are wasting their time.

When you say, "I don't discriminate." You are excusing yourself from helping resolve the problem.

If you immediately call out "I don't want to be a token woman speaker!" or "Why would we select less qualified people just because of gender?" you are actually saying talented women, including yourself, don't exist or aren't worthy.

If you say "Everything is fine for me!" you are shaming those for whom it's not fine.

Imagine responding a little bit differently, allowing yourself to see those issues you, as a woman, have faced. Giving yourself that deserved acceptance that discrimination you face was not your fault. Acknowledging that while you have overcome the odds, maybe it wasn't right that you had to invest so much of yourself to do so.

If you can do that, you let go of shame that comes with discrimination and your heart opens to helping others. To being compassionate. To understanding that recruiting women isn't a negative, it's a positive. That diversity isn't politically correct it's inclusive and therefore a larger pool of talent and skill.

So many times, as women, we learn to endure, to buck up, to take it, to balance it all, to be superstars. What we need to learn to do is acknowledge the reality of our world and work together to bring improvements for everyone and to do so without guilt, without a sense of failure or neediness, but rather as proud members of a strong community.
