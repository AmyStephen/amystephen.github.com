This is one of those *thankfully* rare examples of how to *completely* use pronouns in a sexist manner.

![Not all PHP developers are male.]({{ site.url }}/assets/PHP PRogrammer.jpg)

Now, before you say it, I realize this was produced by someone who likely does not use English as a primary
language. Further, I get it that there is nothing that specifically excludes women by saying directly "only
men are PHP programmers." What it does, however, is clearly exclude women from consideration and does so
 on an education piece related to hiring PHP developers.

In terms of content, it's quite a good piece! Further, it's colorful, uses a balanced design, and catches
the readers content. It would be awesome to fix this.

Here are examples of how to improve the information in a way that is inclusive.

1. Title: change 'While Hiring Them" to "when hiring."
2. Developer images: Since there are two pictures of developers, change one to an image of a female developer.
3. Change: 'Ask About His Experience" to 'Ask about experience'.
4. Change: 'you should ask a developer is about his experience that whether he is experienced or not' to
'Ask developers to share examples of their work to evaluate their experience and skill.'
5. Change: 'Ask About His PHP & HTML Programming Knowledge" to 'Ask about PHP and HTML Programming Knowledge."

In general, it's best to avoid any pronoun use. Think about it for a minute. When hiring developers, what we
care about is experience, skill, work ethic, reliability, enthusiasm, willingness to learn, easy to get along with,
and so on. These characteristics are not gender specific so in reality there is no reason to introduce gender
in such writing.

Like all things, be it learning how to filter data correctly or read contents from a file, it takes time
and practice to learn a skill. The same is true with writing. You'd be surprised how easy it is to
avoid pronouns in your writing. Just takes a woman's touch. ;-)
