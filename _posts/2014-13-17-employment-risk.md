Today, [Dave Winer] blogged about a difficult time in his employer history where he
was apparently sued by a developer code-named 'Roy Wildstein' fired for non-performance.
I would comment on Dave's post, as I have done but closed the comments and encouraged those
who wanted to respond to do so via a blog.

# Hello Dave Winder. I see your Roy Wildstein and I raise you one Julie Ann Horvath.

This comment you made was a doozy.

   But every time a company hires someone who is not a young male, they run the risk that the new hire isn't there to work, rather is there to scam you.

In the past, I have defended some of your comments, but today, I just can't do that. As a woman, you might understand
how I might be offended that your experience with one non performing developer, 20 years your senior, has lead you
to conclude any of us who weren't just like you were at the time -- a young white male -- somehow increase the risk
to our employing company that we plan to scam them.

I have over 30 years in the industry. I worked hard. Most of the time, I worked well over 60 hours a week. I have had
excellent performance records, a history of promotions and increasing salary and responsibilities. Never did I find
the need to sue my employer, nor did any of the women or non-20 years old white males I worked with.

Let me suggest an alternative risk factor: spoon feeding your 'vision' via daily doses of specifications to a developer with 20 years more experience.
Sounds like he played you. Too bad you didn't understand his lack of respect for your futuristic vision and his willingness to screw you over.
It's unfortunate that experience has left you distrustful of anyone who isn't a young white male.

Giving your propensity for giant jumps in logic and the fact that you have left me no method of first verifying my
assumptions, you'll forgive me if I assume you are really speaking
about [Julie Ann Horvath's](https://twitter.com/nrrrdcore)
[recent experiences](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/)
at Github that are just now hitting your Twitter stream.

To be clear:

* Julie didn't go public with her concerns. She responded to public allegations made about her after she resigned.
* Through her [public statements](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/),
we've learned that she has been dealing with this problem for a year before she finally found it so intolerable she had to resign.
* Never once during that time did she make any public references to what she has now described as so difficult she sometimes sat crying in the restroom at her place of work.
* It has obviously been a painful year for her and heartbreaking, given how hard she worked to address diversity issues at work only to find herself in a hostile work environment, herself.

Github [has](https://github.com/blog/1800-update-on-julie-horvath-s-departure) apologized to her, expressed respect and appreciation for her work, and placed two employees on leave and prohibited someone involved from entering the place of business.

It would be easy to respond in frustration to Julie's experiences and say every time a company hires
a young white male, they run the risk of harming women. But, that would be spreading [FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt)
and it wouldn't help Julie or other men and women who find themselves in her situation.

What I will say is anyone who hires Julie should know she comes with [high praise](https://github.com/blog/1800-update-on-julie-horvath-s-departure)
from the CIO of Github. She has the unconditional support and respect
of countless of us who appreciate her creativity, strong work ethic, integrity and strength of character.

The technology community not only has a positive role model in Julie, but through her work producing
[Passion Projects](http://passion-projects.github.com/), each month we have another example of someone who didn't just
punch in at work on time, but came to live their passion and exceed all expectations. Any one of those women
depicted in the series would be a huge benefit to any company fortunate enough to hire them.

In my 30 years in the industry, I've had the great fortune of working along side both women and men of integrity and
creativity, young and old, short and tall, fat and thin, of many ethnic groups. Hiring is a difficult and risky. There
are no easy ways to mitigate risk, certainly there is nothing about skin color or gender that provides a reasonable
  prediction about performance.
