tl/dr - Please follow [Margaret](https://twitter.com/dead_lugosi) and give her feedback on her [multiplayer game](http://brunegame.com).

Yesterday, I tweeted:

  SUPPORT FEMALE DEVS: @dead_lugosi created an interactive game where many players are needed: http://brunegame.com  Please join in / RT!

A couple of my good Twitter friends, @skoop and frankdejonge challenged me, asking
me if they should test it because the developer is a woman or because the game is worth their time. It
was suggested that my tweet was a form of reverse discrimination.

My response was that in the past nearly ten
 years of working in open source I have primarily supported, trained, assisted and promoted men. I didn't (and don't)
 see a tweet promoting women as an issue. It was suggested that doing so was a form of reverse discrimination and
 that all of my efforts helping men were driven by a desire to help men but rather just to offer help. For that
 reason, it didn't count as counterweight to the is discriminatory tweet.

 Rather than engage in YASTD*, I mentioned that I would collect my thoughts in a post for their later review. =)

## Women can't

![Inclusion of Women in Olympic Ski Jumping]
(http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/04/07/sports/olympics/07skijumpingpix/07skijumpingpix-popup.jpg)

Not to get sidetracked, but I wonder how many people know that the [Sochi Games in 2014](http://www.olympic.org/sochi-2014-winter-olympics)
 will be the first time women will be allowed to compete in ski jumping.
For years, female athletes have fought for inclusion.
In a [2005 interview with NPR](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5011904),
the president of the International Ski Federation, Gian Franco Kasper, told reporters that there are
"very few ladies who are really good in jumping."
And that the physical strain "seems not to be appropriate for ladies from a medical point of view."

The thinking being a woman's uterus might fall out or become severely damaged by the repeated impact as a result of the
jump. Reading reminded me of Kathrine Switzer's [account](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGXvBAmTsY)
Boston Marathon run in 1967. It is ridiculous nearly 60 years later to see how little these men know about
how well a woman's uterus is secured in her body. =)

## Back when I started and now

I have often said that current times for women in technology remind me of when I started back in the early 1980's.
    The [statistics seem to support my perception](http://m.collegian.psu.edu/news/state_national_international/article_c109636e-295f-11e3-acaa-0019bb30f31a.html?mode=jqm_gal)
    that female developers rose for 20 years and then fell for 20 years and we are down to 1980 levels.

Now, I don't claim to understand why this has happened. But, I do know that the involvement of women developers is
even less in open source. If you look at the various project developer teams, rarely will you find a woman on the team.
I know from personal experience that having your ideas heard, being selected on the basis of merit, being asked
to participate as a developer after years of contributions is easier for men then it is for women. There is some bias
at play. There is simply no denying it.

It's complex. People are unaware of their biases. Those who are asked to participate want to believe they earned it.
No one wants to think they got an opportunity they didn't earn.

You may disagree with me on this but I believe the reason there might not be many women who are competitive at
Ski Jumping is women have not been given the chance to compete at Olympic levels. Starting this year, that changes.

I have helped men for nearly ten years in open source communities. I have promoted their work. I have helped them make
important connections with others. I have trained them on what they need to know to be productive. I have protected them,
run interference for them. I have done this because I have cared about each and every one of them and wanted to help
them be successful. I will not ever stop doing so.

## Reversing the trend

I believe there are some things that can be done to help reverse the downward trend of women in technology. It's
not something that can be fixed overnight. We are talking about generations.

First, it's important to look at how we raise our children to make certain we don't discourage girls from pursuing
areas of interest and aptitude and that we don't dampen competitiveness and assertiveness as "un-ladylike."
 Except for the most conservative, I believe there is broad
agreement across most political spectrum that this is a valid and important goal.

Also, I believe today's women
need to unlearn some of the 'grooming' we were raised with and learn to be much more brave about sharing
their work and become much more assertive about getting opportunities they deserve. This point of view is
one that you might find in Sheryl Sandberg's [Lean In](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-In-Women-Work-Will/dp/0385349947) message.
Some are critical of this type of message because it is perceived to be blaming women for what is felt to be
[institutional discrimination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutionalized_discrimination). I personally believe
there are some valid points in the opposition to a "Lean In" campaign and encourage those interested to
read bell hook's [take on it](http://thefeministwire.com/2013/10/17973/).

Finally, I think it's important for women to help women. Any group that has a problem needs to work together
to fix it. So, I proudly promote women in technology. I want women to know they aren't alone, that there are
others of us out there who want to work in harmony as sisters,
that we support one another and that we promote important achievements made by women in technology.

I won't stopping helping men. And, I will continue to promote developers who are women who are developers.
Both are positives, there is not a zero sum game of love and support we have to offer one another.
There is no reason for any concern.

## You may disagree.

And you are entitled to your opinion, and I to mine. Let's make certain in 2014 that we agree to show one another
respect and we learn how to talk about these issues without inflammatory response. If we can do that, we already
made huge progress.

*YASTD - yet another silly twitter debate.
