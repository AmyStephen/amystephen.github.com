I saw a word used recently that, in my opinion, ranks right up there with the "N" word.
It is not a word that should be said by a man concerned he might be
misunderstood as disrespectful to women.

It offended me.

It made me sad to see the only mention of the word was done in such a way that it mocked
those of us who might find it offensive.

I felt alone as others responded without correcting the offense.

I knew there was nothing I could do or say because in doing so a debate would be sparked as to whether or not the
word was acceptable. I would be told I was being too sensitive. That it was just a joke. That it's
no different than this word or that word. That other things in life matter far more than using a specific word.
That I needed to shut the fuck up.

So, I was quiet.
