Reflecting back on 30 years in the Information Technology field, it's clear the constant debate between *Doing it Right*™ crowd and the *Making it Easy*™ group is scored by users. Be it Windows 3.1 versus OS/2 or WordPress versus other full featured open source CMS, in the end, people use what helps them deliver.  Academics can say what they will.

Our learning as technologists should guide us to build useful products for users. Our discussions and debate as a community of developers can be useful to help us in that process. But, we need to be careful that our common areas are not overrun by those who wish to use it as a stage as they duke it out for the crown of King of the Proverbial Hill. The space must be protected for productive, friendly, collaborative conversation and debate in order to ensure a community members can openly ask questions and share ideas for solving problems for users.

* Show me what your code can do. *I'll listen.*
* Give me an example of how I can solve my problems as a site builder using your solutions. *I'll all in.*
* Explain to me why you elected to use this design pattern over another and *I will learn.*

Too many times, community dialog becomes combative and sophomoric, be it on Reddit, through blog posts, via forum posts, using podcasts, where a few are constantly fire-hosing disagree with what other developers have accomplished.

* No acknowledgement of the *benefit* users derive from that work.
* No *example* of the how to obtain the same benefit differently.
* No code in hand.

Absent real examples of code, I question whether the advise is based on the kind of experience that would help me build solutions users need.
